# Tic Tac Toe API

#Write the docs (and only the docs) for a Tic Tac Toe API. They can be free-form, or use a standardized API description language such as [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

#The API must:
#- be RESTful and use JSON to encode data
#- support two-player games
#- allow players to play against anonymous users
#- allow players to play against a specific friend
#- be optimized for the development of user-friendly UIs

#All other details are left up to you.
